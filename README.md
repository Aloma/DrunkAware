# DrunkAware
An Android application designed for a person in distress
When someone is out late night, drunk or unconscious or in an emergency where one is not able to respond to calls, messages or send a signal of any kind, it becomes difficult to locate the person or understand the situation. We present an application for a person in distress. This application recognizes a context where recurrent calls are being received from the same person or continuous text messages such as ‘where are you?’ or ‘we are looking for you’ and respond to it by sending the current location to the contact via SMS, if he is present in the pre-specified emergency list and updates about his subsequent movements. Our application recognizes call patterns and analysis of the text messages from the emergency contact to send the location of the user to the contact. Our system also alerts the user regarding the situation and has additional features such as automated opening of the cab booking application on gauging the emergency context.
